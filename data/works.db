{"type":"book","title":"Giving to God: Islamic charity in revolutionary times","publisher":"University of California Press","publisher-place":"Oakland, California","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","event-place":"Oakland, California","abstract":"\"During the 2011 uprising, hundreds of thousands of Egyptians took to the streets to call for social justice. Three years later, President el-Sisi promoted economic growth, mega projects, hard work, and citizens' sacrifices. What many of the activists and el-Sisi have in common, despite their radically different visions, is an objection to charity and handouts--to 'giving a man a fish.' Set against this drastically shifting historical backdrop, this book describes an alternative vision of justice: an Islamic ethics of giving that is enacted in Cairo's alleys, mosque courtyards, saint shrines, and slums. It tells the story of a range of pious Muslims--housewives, Sufi devotees, and Salafi volunteers--who, day after day, hand out meals to the poor, and it tells the story of people at the receiving end--beggars, single-parent families, and dervishes. This form of giving is not grounded in compassion, the desire to end poverty, or the hope for a better world, but rather it is understood as a duty and a way to interact with God. By initiating an unlikely conversation between such lived understandings of Islam and the revolutionary moment, this book invites a reimagining of justice and ethics beyond 'the human.' It ethnographically disrupts the entrenched claim that handouts are outdated, shortsighted, and damaging--that they inherently and necessarily stand in the way of social justice\"--Provided by publisher","ISBN":"978-0-520-30082-8","call-number":"BP170.25 .M58 2019","title-short":"Giving to God","author":[{"family":"Mittermaier","given":"Amira"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"_id":"4udz0QY7qj0xxmdp"}

Research on newspapers and the public sphere is valuable because it has focused on this paradox of mediation at the center of modern political life. Whereas liberal theories of the public sphere sought to distinguish a rational reading public forged through a dialectic self-abstraction from what Habermas once termed “pressure from the street,” recent work on the politics of the crowd and that of the reading public reveals a closer relationship.

However, accounts of microbial-human partnerings have yet to explore how producers, consumers, and regulators use their imaginings of microbiological activity to shape individual action. How do these understandings and imaginings of microbial life shape relationships with the state in an environment where citizens expect and demand that their government promote food safety via regulatory intervention? This article provides a theoretical framework for understanding producer and consumer responses to the regulatory crackdown over minimal levels of alcohol in kombucha in the U.S., as well as larger conversations about human–microbe relationships. Through interviews with kombucha producers and consumers, media analysis, and observation, I develop the concept of microbiological citizenship to analyze how producers and consumers of kombucha – a fermented tea – sought to preserve their relations with microbial life in the face of regulatory crackdown. Producer practices to re-manage and preserve microbial life in the face of structural difficulties suggest that for post-Pasteurians, encouragement of human–microbe relationships creates new ties of responsibility that promote collaboration rather than competition.

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392","ISSN":"0002-9602","author":[{"family":"Granovetter","given":"Mark S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1973"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,7]]},"_id":"OxsMiqMXtBa10bzC"}

{"type":"article-journal","title":"Time and Relational Possibility: Cultural Anthropology in 2017","container-title":"American Anthropologist","page":"305-327","volume":"120","issue":"2","source":"Wiley Online Library","abstract":"This essay reviews work produced in predominantly US cultural anthropology publications throughout 2017. It asks: What makes an anthropological inquiry timely, what sorts of relationalities command anthropological attention, and to what end? Noting our ongoing methodological commitment to long-term ethnography alongside increasingly important online forums for reaching broader publics and responding quickly to emerging issues, it expands the range of work surveyed to include some online-only short essays alongside the larger collection of traditionally published research articles. Characterized by empathic inquiry, frequently drawing on years of ethnographic and personal experience with the places, people, and other entities that we write about, and often attentive to histories at multiple scales, cultural anthropology of this moment, however published, grapples with dark times while it also offers ways of imagining other, better futures and ways of being in relation to others. Two thematic clusters organize this essay: the first considers temporality alongside mobility and sovereignty, and the second considers relationality alongside subjectivity and mediation. Together, all of these concerns—that are both of the moment and long standing—build a varied body of work that grapples with the interrelationalities that constitute power, place, and possibility. I argue that what makes an anthropological inquiry timely is the extent to which it is relationally informed and attuned to care for worlds that we inhabit and imagine, together.

The second section, “Shifting Political Economies,” deals with publications that specifically explore how political economic conditions are otherwise than was the case when linguistic anthropologists began formulating approaches to the political economies of language in the immediate post–Cold War period. In a third section, “Evidence and/of Imagination,” I examine how linguistic anthropological works published in the period under review have used the terms “imagine/imagined/imaginary” in polyvalent senses when exploring how alternative worlds are conceived and produced, and consider how this nontechnical term can allow scholars to evade or to open up questions of scale and evidence. The final section, “Linguistic Anthropology Could be Otherwise,” takes up work in 2017 that asks how the practice of linguistic anthropology itself could be—and should be—otherwise in terms of our engagements outside the field and the scope of our theoretical and political imaginations.

Driving After Class explores middle-class anxieties and suburban life during those years. Drawing on nineteen months of ethnographic research in a suburban New Jersey town as McMansions sprouted up next to subdivisions of moderately sized colonial-style homes and infrastructural essentials like schools and roads became overburdened, each chapter throws into relief subtle gradations within the middle class and among middle-class sensibilities, and brings to life the ways that people were reorienting themselves--both consciously and unconsciously--to the discursive and material displacement of postwar liberal approaches to middle-class life in favor of newly dominant neoliberal logics. The ethnographic moments illustrated in the book, drawn from fieldwork in people's homes, their town hall, and their SUVs, reveal the ways that efforts to appease feelings of insecurity--whether through place-making practices, childrearing strategies, or 'had-to-have' purchases--often made people (and their neighbors) feel and be less secure. The economics and cultural politics of the constellation of these ways of being, which I have termed 'rugged entitlement,' ended up steering many children, youth, and parents into ambivalence about the structuring and texture of their everyday lives: it is exhausting work to be strategically and persistently driving after class. But more often than not, unable to imagine the possibility of crafting another way of life, most curbed these unsettling doubts and resolutely fueled up for the ride\"--Provided by publisher","ISBN":"978-0-520-27774-8","call-number":"HN79.N53 S6155 2015","title-short":"Driving after class","author":[{"family":"Heiman","given":"Rachel"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"_id":"n9Ufdr3kJumKB1dj"}

For the last three centuries new ideas of Nature have been continuously developed by theology, politics, economics, and science, especially the sciences of the material world. The situation is even more unstable today, now that we have entered an ecological mutation of unprecedented scale. Some call it the Anthropocene, but it is best described as a new climatic regime. And a new regime it certainly is, since the many unexpected connections between human activity and the natural world oblige every one of us to reopen the earlier notions of Nature and redistribute what had been packed inside. So the question now arises: what will replace the old ways of looking at Nature? This book explores a potential candidate proposed by James Lovelock when he chose the name \"Gaia\" for the fragile, complex system through which living phenomena modify the Earth. The fact that he was immediately misunderstood proves simply that his readers have tried to fit this new notion into an older frame, transforming Gaia into a single organism, a kind of giant thermostat, some sort of New Age goddess, or even divine Providence. In this series of lectures on \"natural religion\", Bruno Latour argues that the complex and ambiguous figure of Gaia offers, on the contrary, an ideal way to disentangle the ethical, political, theological, and scientific aspects of the now obsolete notion of Nature. He lays the groundwork for a future collaboration among scientists, theologians, activists, and artists as they, and we, begin to adjust to the new climatic regime\"--","ISBN":"978-0-7456-8433-8","call-number":"QH331 .L3313 2017","title-short":"Facing Gaia","language":"eng","author":[{"family":"Latour","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Porter","given":"Catherine"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"_id":"yCOwSSYkApMrEX9b"}
